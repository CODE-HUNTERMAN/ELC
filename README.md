# 🌾 Peer-To-Peer Smart Agriculture System  

## 📷 Pomegranate Disease Detection using Machine Learning

### 📌 Project Overview

This project is a part of the **Peer-To-Peer Smart Agriculture System** that aims to modernize farming by integrating machine learning techniques for plant disease detection. Our focus is on detecting various **pomegranate plant diseases** using image processing and different ML models.

The goal is to provide farmers with an easy-to-use, intelligent system to identify plant diseases early, enabling timely treatment and reducing crop losses.
